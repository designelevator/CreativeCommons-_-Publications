# CreativeCommons-_-Publications

In leading innovation processes, through human center design approach, we have created diverse publications, we aim to make many of them accessible to others and to be used.

In this repository you will find a collection of them, organised (or not).

In the case where the material was made specifically for a client, these are published here with their authorisation.

Assume that all what is in this folder is covered by the Creative Commons licence CC-BY-SA v.3.0.
--> You can download use and modify the material
--> You may use them for commercial purpose
--> YOU MUST mention us as authors or creators of the original material in the new created material
--> YOU MUST share it under the same conditions as this material.

Have fun in your activities !
